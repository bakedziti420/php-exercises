# PHP Exercises

Now that we know the basics of PHP, see how many of the following tasks you can accomplish.  Use the [previous lesson](ttps://github.com/den-wdi-2/php-intro) as a resource.

## The Tasks

Turn on your MAMP server, create a folder inside your MAMP working directory called `php_exercises`, and create a file called `index.php`.  You will do all your work inside this file.

Once you have this file, go to `http://localhost:8888` in your browser and navigate to your `php_exercises` folder.  This should show a blank page...but not for long!

1. Get php to `echo` "Hello World!"
1. Replace `World` with a variable called `$place` and use string concatenation to `echo` the new string.
1. Get php to `echo` all numbers from 1 to 20
1. Create a variable called $name, and save a string to it (your name or a friend's name)
1. Create three `<p>` tags, one that says "Name Too Short", one that says "Name Long Enough", and one that says "Name Has No Length"
1. Using conditionals, have the `<p>` tags show up if $name is less than 5 characters, greater than or equal to 5 characters, and for any other case, respectively.
1. Create a class for `animal` with three properties.  Echo these properties to the browser.  Make sure you're using the right type of properties that allow you to `echo` them outside of the class declaration.
1. Create a class for `cat` that `extends` `animal` and has three additional properties.  Echo all six of `cat`s properties to the browser.
1. Get php to `echo` three simple math problems and their solutions.
1. Create an array of 7 numbers, and print all the values out to page.
1. Create an associative array of three names and their ages, and print all the names and ages out to page.
